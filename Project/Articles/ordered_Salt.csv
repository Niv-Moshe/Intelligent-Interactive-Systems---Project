they agreed that efforts to reduce excessive sodium were warranted
it recommends 23 grams per day
people who consumed less than 3 grams of sodium per day
in 2011 researchers published a study in the journal of the american medical association
after following 3681 people over almost a decade
americans consume on average 34 grams of sodium per day
why theres surprisingly little rationale for this belief
concerning sodium intake around the world
if we in the medical community hadnt seen it before
the united states food and drug administration thinks thats not low enough
but they cautioned that no such evidence existed to recommend a very low salt diet
they too found that excessive salt intake was associated with high blood pressure
this is on the low end of the safe zone of 36 grams in the study
in addition to looking at high sodium diets
the world health organization says it should be 20 grams
of a diet where sodium intake was 15 to 23 grams per day
it compared the health outcomes of those who had very low sodium diets
they also found that a lowsodium diet was associated with higher mortality from cardiovascular causes
when compared with those who consumed 36 grams per day
the american heart association goes even further
they hoped that future research would assess the potential benefits
than those who consumed more than 7 grams per day
or about the equivalent of three and a half tablespoons of soy sauce
this result would be shocking
last year experts convened by the institute of medicine assessed the evidence
but we have
the second new england journal of medicine study did just that
and recommends we consume no more than 15 grams
what they found was worrisome
had an even higher risk of death or cardiovascular incidents
